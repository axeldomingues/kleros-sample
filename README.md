# The Graph - Kleros Sample

This is a sample implementation of a simple subgraph of The Graph protocol. This sample demonstrates how easy is to index and query data from blockchains which, otherwise would be difficult to query directly.

In this specific example, we are indexing Kleros, which is a blockchain dispute resolution layer. The goal is to index and query disputes and phases. In this exercise, we want to ask a straightforward question that would be difficult to answer without The Graph protocol. For example, how many disputes exist per phase and which specific disputes exist per phase.
